Hello! My name is Mohammad Hassan Eskandari, Senior Game Programmer.
I was born in 1994 and grew up in Mashhad, Iran.
I earned my Bachelor Degree in Software Engineering in 2019. 
As a CS graduate, my favorite fields are Serious Games, Human-Computer Interaction, and Information Visualization.
In general, I am interested in helping people with special needs, especially children, by gamifying problems and visualizing information.
